<p>The Punjab government has decided to impose a ban on political gatherings in Lahoreâ€™s Greater Iqbal Park, which is the home to the historic Minar-e-Pakistan, until further orders.</p>
<p>The development emerged from a recent meeting held with Chief Minister (CM) Punjab, Hamza Shehbaz, in the chair. During the meeting, the CM was informed that the provincial exchequer incurred a loss of Rs. 5 million due to the recent political gathering at Greater Iqbal Park.</p>
<p>As a result, CM Hamza Shehbaz issued directions to ban public gatherings at Greater Iqbal Park, ordering the authorities to ensure the ban is observed in letter and spirit.</p>
